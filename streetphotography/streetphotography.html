	<h1>The Ultimate Guide to Street Photography </h1>
	<h2>by James Maher</h2>
	<p>Street photography is an inherently clunky term, and because of this, there are many street photographers that dislike it. They consider themselves photographers, plain and simple.</p>
	<p>The first image that typically comes to mind for the term street photography, is an image of a stranger just walking down the street in a city like New York, London, or Tokyo</p>
	<div class="stwrapperA">
		<p class="gwshiftA">This is a huge part of street photography of course, but it <br>is only one part, and it can <br>cause confusion over the true<br> meaning of what street <br>photography really is all about, <br>and how it can be done.</p>
		<p class="gwshiftA">Street photography is candid photography of life and human <br>nature. It is a way for us to <br>show our surroundings, and <br>how we as photographers<br> relate to them. We are <br>filtering what we see, to find<br> the moments that intrigue us, <br>and to then share them with <br>others. It’s like daydreaming <br>with a camera.</p>

	<p>People do not need to be present for an image to be considered a street photograph. The photograph does not need to be taken in a city, or in a busy market. It can be taken anywhere and can portray nearly anything, as long as it isn’t posed or manipulated. It can be shot at a family barbecue, or in the middle of 5th Avenue in New York City.</p>

	<p>While many may consider the term clunky, there is an elegant side to it as well; that I think is often missed. The street is the most public and accessible of places. Street photography is the most public and accessible form of photography. Anyone can do it. You do not need an expensive camera. You do not need a big studio, professional lighting, or beautiful models. We all have the same content out there, and it’s up to us to figure out how to capture that and bring it home.</p>
	<div class="stwrapperB">
		<p>In addition, while technical quality is always important to every form of photography, it is not celebrated in street photography in quite the same way. A nature or landscape image needs to be sharp. It usually needs to be able to be printed at large sizes with great technical quality. In these genres, you can pick the perfect location, frame it the perfect way, choose the perfect equipment and settings, and continue to come back until you get the perfect lighting.</p>

	<p>With street photography, on the other hand, the best image of your life can pop right in front of you on the way to get your morning coffee. This spontaneity is what’s celebrated. That is why grainy images, slightly off-kilter framing a-la Garry Winogrand, or imperfect focus will not always ruin a street photograph. Sometimes they will, and we must aim for technical mastery, but other times they can add to the realness of the moment. Sometimes these deficiencies may actually improve the image.</p>

	<div class="stwrapperC">
		<p class="gwshiftA">But these are decisions that <br>can’t be taught. Many of them <br>are spontaneous and instinctive.<br> That is why you can’t buy or<br> read your way into mastery of<br> street photography. You are <br>on the same plane as every <br>other photographer. The only<br> thing standing between you<br> and them is the time spent <br>out there paying your dues, <br>waiting for those intriguing <br>moments to occur, and<br> improving your ability to notice<br> and bring them back with you.</p>
